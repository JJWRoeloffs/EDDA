**a)**

**b)**

## Exercise 4


**a)-b)** In these both cases the null hypothesis H0 holds because
`mu=nu=180`.

## a)

## b)


**c)**


**d)** The null hypothesis H0 holds in a) and b) as `mu=nu`. Under H0,
p-values are distributed uniformly on [0,1]. Hence the events {p\<0.05}
and {p\<0.1} should occur approximately in 5% and 10% of cases
respectively, and histograms of p-values should be close to uniform on
[0,1]. In b) the approximations should be better because the variance is
smaller.

In c) H0 does not hold (because `mu>nu`), so p-values are not uniformly
distributed and `mean(p<0.05)` gives approximately the values of the
power function at point `mu-nu=180-175=5`, which should approach 1 for a
good test.

All these claims are confirmed by the simulations results in a), b) and
c).
