## Exercise 2

We generate samples from the asked distributions and plot for each of
the generated samples the histogram, boxplot and QQ-plot:

```{r, fig.height=2.6, fig.width=6}
par(mfrow=c(1,3)) # two plots next each other
sample=rlnorm(10000,2,2) # from the lognormal distribution with mu=sigma=2
hist(sample,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=1000) # hist(sample) will not look good, why?
# to see the breaks: hist(sample,xlim=c(0,100),breaks=1000)$breaks
boxplot(sample) # a lot of outliers
qqnorm(sample) # of course, not normal

sample=rbinom(40,50,0.25) # from the binomial distribution with n=50 and p=0.25
hist(sample);boxplot(sample);qqnorm(sample) # looks like normal

sample=runif(60,-2,3) #from the uniform distribution on the interval [-2,3]
hist(sample);boxplot(sample);qqnorm(sample) # of course, not normal

sample=rpois(200,350) #from the Poisson distribution with lambda = 350
hist(sample);boxplot(sample);qqnorm(sample) # looks like normal
```

All but lognormal are symmetric (possibly not around zero), binomial and
Poisson look like normal. Small sample sizes (10,40,60) show noise.
Histograms are more stable and give better approximation of the true
density for sufficiently large sample sizes.
